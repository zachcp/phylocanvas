# phylocanvas

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/phylocanvas)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=phylocanvas)

Use phylocanvas to draw phylogenetic trees in the browser. Basic options to control the tree are availalbe in this top level function. The tree shape in controlled by the `treetype` option. Try 'radial' and 'heirarchical' as well.

## Installation

You can install phylocanvas from github with:

```{r  eval = FALSE}
install.packages("phylocanvas")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("phylocanvas")

tree <- ape::read.tree("(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F;")

phycanv <- phylocanvas(tree,treetype = "rectangular", alignlabels = T)

# stylize nodes
phycanv %>%
  style_node("A", nodesizeratio = 4, fillcolor="rgb(0, 255, 0)") %>% 
  style_node("B", fillcolor = "blue") %>%
  style_node("C", labeltextsize = 10, shape="triangle") %>%
  style_node("D", fillcolor="#ffa500", highlighted=TRUE) 
```



Latest Information
------------------

See the [documentation webpage](https://zachcp.github.io/phylocanvas/) fot the latest information.


Roadmap
-------

Not expecting 1:1 parity with the pure JS version. The goal is to expose the basic styling and sizing to allow easy tree drawing within R. Possibly, to use the metadata plugin for heatmap displays and ideally (don't know how hard this will be) allow drag and drop selection for returnign sequence names into shiny.

Reference
---------

The sourcecode for the phylocanvas htmltools package can be found at the [github repo](https://github.com/zachcp/phylocanvas). For more information about the phylocanvas JavaScript library, check out the [phylocanvas website](http://phylocanvas.org).

Events
------

The `phylocanvas` events are catched and can be used from a shiny app. The following events can be used:

### Subtree drawn

```{r subtree_event, eval=FALSE}
input$subtree_drawn # returns the node from which the tree was drawn
```

### Nodes selected

```{r udpate_event, eval=FALSE}
input$tree_selection # returns the list of selected nodes
```

### Tree loading

```{r loading_event, eval=FALSE}
input$tree_loading
```

### Before tree is drawn

```{r before_draw_event, eval=FALSE}
input$tree_beforeFirstDraw
```

### Tree loaded

```{r loaded_event, eval=FALSE}
input$tree_loaded
```

### Error

```{r error_event, eval=FALSE}
input$error
```
